# Media Streamer

This is a Media Stream WSS server to Google/Microsoft speech server. The purpose is to enable Twilio Media Streams (multichannel inbound / outbound) to stream audio to the appropriate backend. Text that is captured is then streamed to Twilio Sync for further processing (e.g. Flex Plugin)

## Getting Started
Ensure that you have the appropriate keys from Google/Microsoft for the respective backends. Configure these in the .env file
